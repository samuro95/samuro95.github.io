abstract: The Expected Patch Log-Likelihood method, introduced by Zoran and Weiss, allows for whole image restoration using a patch-based prior (in the likelihood sense) for which a maximum a-posteriori (MAP) estimate can be calculated. The prior used is a Gaussian mixture model whose parameters are learned from a dataset of natural images. This article presents a detailed implementation of the algorithm in the context of denoising of images contaminated with white additive Gaussian noise. In addition, two possible extensions of the algorithm to handle color images are compared.
