summary: Seminar *Convergence analysis of Plug-and-Play algorithms for image inverse problems*

abstract: Plug-and-play (PnP) methods are a class of iterative algorithms for imaging inverse problems, leveraging off-the-shelf Gaussian denoisers for regularization. These methods achieve impressive visual results, especially when deep neural networks parameterize the denoisers. However, the theoretical convergence of PnP methods has yet to be fully established. This talk provides an overview of the PnP literature, introduces new convergence results for PnP algorithms when paired with specific denoisers, and finally, presents a novel Bregman version of Plug-and-Play.

Slides can be added in a few ways:

- **Create** slides using Wowchemy's [_Slides_](https://wowchemy.com/docs/managing-content/#create-slides) feature and link using `slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Upload** an existing slide deck to `static/` and link using `url_slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Embed** your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using [shortcodes](https://wowchemy.com/docs/writing-markdown-latex/).

Further event details, including [page elements](https://wowchemy.com/docs/writing-markdown-latex/) such as image galleries, can be added to the body of this page. -->
